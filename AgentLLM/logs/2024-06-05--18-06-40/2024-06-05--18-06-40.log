<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Based on the current state, I am at position [13, 12] looking East and I can observe three agents: Tom at [12, 18], Emily at [8, 16], and Jack at [9, 18]. There are no explicit rules or hypotheses from the world knowledge that explain the positions of these agents. However, I can infer that the agents are moving independently and have their own goals or strategies, which may include exploring, gathering resources, or interacting with the environment in ways that are not immediately visible to me. The lack of changes observed in the environment between my last action (no action executed yet) and the current state suggests that the environment is static unless an agent takes an action that directly affects it.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-05-26 at 18:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1, 2
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents try to maximize their reward.</3>
<4>Cookies are a limited resource.</4>
<5>Pablo can take more actions than me, so he has an advantage.</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
If I move to an unexplored location or revisit the places where I have found cookies I might find other cookies. But Pablo have been eating cookies much faster than me, so the cookies could have been depleted.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>

<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Reasoning: The observations of dirt on the river indicate a build-up of dirt over time, suggesting a gradual process of dirt accumulation on the river. This could be due to various factors such as erosion, rainfall runoff, or pollution. Given the pattern of dirt distribution along the river, it is likely that the dirt originates from a common source upstream and flows downstream, gradually spreading out across the river. The presence of dirt at multiple positions along the river suggests that the dirt accumulation is a continuous process, and the downstream positions are likely to have higher dirt accumulation compared to the upstream positions.

</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe continued dirt accumulation on the river, especially at the downstream positions. The dirt distribution may continue to spread out across the river, and new dirt may appear at positions further downstream. The amount of dirt observed is expected to increase over time as the dirt accumulation process continues.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>

<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.
