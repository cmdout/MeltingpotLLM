Now it's 2024-07-02 17:00:00 and the reward obtained by me is 0.0. I am at the position [8, 6] looking to the West.
I can observe the following:
Observed dirt on the river at position [5, 6]
Observed agent Tom at position [7, 4].
Observed dirt on the river at position [5, 5]
Observed dirt on the river at position [4, 6]

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2024-07-02 17:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (<previous_observations>). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

Answer only in the following format:
<reasoning>
Reasoning: <Think step by step>
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
<The <rules> or <hypotheses> retrieved from <world_knowledge> that allow you to predict the <current_state>. Only display the numbers of the rules separated by a comma>
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<Possible explanations of the inner workings of the world or other agent's behavior that have yet not enough evidence to become rules. The new hypotheses must be enclosed by a numbered tag. If no new hypotheses were created use None. Hypotheses might also include the behavior comprehension of other agents>
</new_world_knowledge>

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: A fascinating example of using observations and knowledge to generate new rules and hypotheses!

Let's break down what we've learned from these examples:

**Example 1: Diamonds**

* Initial observation: Diamonds are not visible, possibly due to limited visual range.
* Future observation: If the agent moves north, they might observe diamonds at positions [7, 10] and [8, 10], which were previously outside their visual field.

This example highlights the importance of considering an agent's position and orientation in relation to its visual range.

**Example 2: Berries**

* Initial observation: Berries are present at positions [11, 14], [10, 14], and [12, 13].
* Action taken: The agent gathers a berry at position [11, 14].
* Observation after gathering: The berry at position [11, 14] is removed from the map, and the agent receives a reward.
* Repeat observations: Berries regenerate at the same positions (e.g., [10, 14]) about 24 hours after being gathered. New berries can also spawn at nearby positions.

The key insights here are:

1. **Regeneration**: Berries reappear at the same position after about 24 hours from the time they were gathered.
2. **New spawns**: New berries can emerge at nearby locations, not strictly confined to previous positions.

These discoveries open up new possibilities for future observations and actions in this world!

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>

<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Based on the previous observations and the current state, I'll use my knowledge (world_knowledge) and create new rules that explain what happened.

**Rule 1: Berry Regeneration**
Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This rule is supported by the observations where berries reappeared at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] a day after being gathered.

**New Knowledge**

* <2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
* <3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>

**Reasoning**
The observations show that gathering a berry removes it from the map, but the same berry reappears after approximately 24 hours. This suggests that berries have a natural regenerative cycle, and they don't simply disappear forever.

Additionally, the new berry at position [11, 13] could be evidence that new berries can spawn at nearby locations, potentially replacing the previously gathered berries.

**Future Observations**
Given this new understanding of berry regeneration, I would expect to see the berry at position [12, 13] disappear after being gathered and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations, further supporting the idea that berries can regenerate in these areas.

  "Reasoning": "Considering Juan is a cooperative person, I will take that into account when making decisions. Since there are no rules yet, I will focus on building positive relationships with the agents and fostering cooperation. With agents Laura and Emily already observed in my vicinity, my goal is to create a harmonious environment where we can work together effectively.

Given the current observations, it seems Juan is nearby, which could be an opportunity for collaboration. I will make an effort to connect with him and establish trust. Similarly, I would like to build rapport with Laura and Emily, who seem to be at distinct locations.

As there are no future predictions yet, my focus will be on the present moment. By creating a cooperative atmosphere, I can potentially uncover new opportunities and strengthen our relationships, ultimately leading to a more positive and prosperous environment for all agents.

The observed positions of the agents suggest that they may have unique roles or responsibilities. I will keep this in mind as I navigate future interactions.

In summary, my reasoning is centered around building trust, fostering cooperation, and establishing harmonious relationships with the other agents.",

Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: Based on the previous observations, I have created new world knowledge and rules that explain the current state.

World Knowledge:

* Rules:
	+ Gathering a berry removes it from the observed map and generates a reward for the agent who gathered it.
	+ Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
	+ New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

New World Knowledge:

* [3] Berries do not regenerate instantly, but rather take approximately 24 hours after being gathered.

Reasoning:
Based on the observations, I have identified patterns that allow me to explain the current state. Berries seem to regenerate at the same position after a period of about 24 hours from when they were gathered. This is evident in the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14], which are roughly a day apart. Additionally, I observed a new berry appearing at position [11, 13], which suggests that berries can spawn at new nearby locations.

Future Observations:
Given my newfound understanding of berry regeneration and spawning, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Used Knowledge: [1]

New World Knowledge:
[2] Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>

<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: This is an example of how to use previous observations and world knowledge to make predictions about future events in a simulation or game.

In this example, there are two observations:

1. The first observation is from 2023-08-15 09:00:00, where the agent observes berries at positions [11, 14], [10, 14], and [12, 13].
2. The second observation is from 2023-08-16 09:00:00, where the agent gathers a berry at position [11, 14] and observes berries at positions [10, 14] and [12, 13].

From these observations, we can infer some rules about how the environment behaves:

1. Gathering a berry removes it from the observed map.
2. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.

These rules allow us to make predictions about future events. For example, if we gather the berry at [12, 13], it will disappear from our observation and reappear the next day.

This type of reasoning is useful for making decisions in complex environments where there are many possible outcomes and uncertainties. By analyzing past observations and using them to inform our decisions, we can make more informed predictions about future events.

Portion of the map explored by Emily: 19.21

Observed changes in the game state:
None

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (14, 17) you observe the following: 
Observed agent Lily at position [17, 20].
Observed agent Laura at position [9, 18].

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: Y: Reasoning: o

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:
```json
{
    "Opportunities": string \\ What are the most relevant opportunities? those that can yield the best benefit for you in the long term

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: As Laura, I analyze my current situation and available observations.

**Opportunities**: Being able to get closer to my goals, which currently are unknown. Having the ability to explore new areas of the map, including positions near the edge, could potentially reveal new information or opportunities.

**Threats**: None observed so far, but being aware of the possibility of encountering other agents, like Emily and Lily, could pose a threat if they have conflicting goals or intentions.

**Options**:

* Explore to gain more information about the map and potentially find new opportunities.
* Go to river bank at (9, 18) to gather more knowledge about my surroundings and potentially find resources or clues.
* Go to apples field edge at ([17, 20]) to see if I can learn more about Emily's location and intentions.

**Consequences**:

* Exploring could lead to new discoveries, but it may also lead me away from potential threats or opportunities.
* Going to the river bank could provide valuable information, but it might also put me in a vulnerable position.
* Going to the apples field edge could reveal more about Emily's plans, but it might also attract unwanted attention.

**Final analysis**: Considering my current lack of goals and unknowns about the world, I believe exploring is the best option. This will allow me to gain more information and potentially uncover new opportunities or threats.

**Answer**: ```json
{
    "Opportunities": "Explore to gain more information",
    "Threats": "Being aware of potential encounters with other agents",
    "Options": "Explore, Go to river bank at (9, 18), Go to apples field edge at ([17, 20])",
    "Consequences": "Gain new knowledge or discover new threats",
    "Final analysis": "Explore to uncover more about the world",
    "Answer": "go to river bank at (9, 18)"

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Observed a berry at position [10, 14].
Observed a berry at position [12, 13].
</current_state>

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

**Analysis**

The example describes an agent that explores a world where diamonds and berries are present. Initially, there are no observations about diamond behavior. Later, the agent gathers some berries, which reveals the rules governing berry regeneration.

From the previous observations (previous_observations), we can deduce the following:

1. Berries disappear from the observed map when gathered.
2. Berries regenerate at the same position after approximately 24 hours from the time they were gathered.
3. New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

These rules and observations together form a coherent picture of the world, which the agent can use to inform its future decisions.

**New Insights**

The current state observation (current_state) presents new information that can be used to refine our understanding of the world:

1. A new berry appeared at position [11, 13].

This observation suggests that berries don't only regenerate at the same positions where they were gathered but also potentially spawn at new nearby locations.

**New World Knowledge**

Based on the analysis and insights from the previous observations and the current state, we can create two new rules:

1. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
2. New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

These rules provide a more comprehensive understanding of the world and its dynamics.

**Future Observations**

With this new knowledge, we can predict future observations:

1. When I gather the berry at position [12, 13], it will disappear from my observation.
2. The next day, the berry might reappear at the same position or potentially spawn at a nearby location.
3. New berries could also appear at unexpected positions.

These predictions are based on our updated understanding of the world and its rules.

I will also keep an eye out for any changes in the game state and adjust my plan accordingly. In the short-term, I aim to gather more information about the dirt and its possible causes, as well as Juan's intentions.

As a cooperative person, I prioritize working together with other agents to achieve common goals. Therefore, my ultimate goal is to find ways to collaborate with Juan and possibly other agents to clean up the river and create a better environment for everyone.",

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Now it's 2023-08-18 09:00:00 and the reward obtained by me is 3.0. I am at the position [11, 14] looking to the west. I can observe the following:
Observed a berry at position [11, 13].
Observed a berry at position [10, 14].
Observed a berry at position [12, 13].
</current_state>

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.
</future_observations>

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: This is an example of how agents can use their observations and reasoning skills to update their knowledge about the world. In this case, the agent has observed that gathering a berry removes it from the observed map and generates a reward. However, after some time passes (approximately 24 hours), the berry reappears at the same position.

From this observation, the agent infers that berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered. Additionally, the agent observes that new berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

The updated knowledge is stored in the `<new_world_knowledge>` section, which includes:

* Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
* New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

This new knowledge can be used to inform future observations and actions. For example, the agent may expect that if they gather a berry, it will disappear from their observation for about 24 hours before reappearing. The agent may also anticipate the appearance of new berries at nearby locations.

In conclusion, this example demonstrates how an agent can use its observations to update its knowledge of the world and make predictions about future events.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: A fascinating example!

Let me summarize what we have:

* Previous observations (ordered from oldest to most recent): gathering a berry removes it from the observed map and generates a reward, but the same position can regenerate the berry after about 24 hours.
* Current state: observing berries at positions [11, 13], [10, 14], and [12, 13].

Using my current world knowledge (rule 1) and considering the previous observations, I'll create new rules to explain the current state:

1. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
2. New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

With these rules in mind, I'd predict that the berry at position [11, 14] will disappear from my observation once I gather it (since it was previously observed), and then regenerate the next day. Similarly, new berries might spawn at unexpected nearby locations.

Here's my analysis:

**Opportunities:**
* The most relevant opportunity is to explore the surrounding area to gain more information about the map and potential threats or benefits.
* Going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map I'm seeing may reveal new observations, which could be beneficial in the long term.

**Threats:**
* None identified yet, but lack of information about the environment poses a threat to my well-being if I don't explore and gather more data.
* Staying in one spot without exploring might limit my chances of finding opportunities or avoiding potential threats.

**Options:**
* Explore the area around me to gain more insights into the map and potential dangers or benefits.
* Go to positions near the edge of the portion of the map I'm seeing to potentially reveal new observations.

**Consequences:**
* Exploring: May lead to new discoveries, increased knowledge about the environment, and potentially reduced uncertainty.
* Going to positions near the edge: May reveal new observations, which could be beneficial in the long term, or uncover potential threats.

**Final analysis:**
Based on Pedro's bio as a cooperative person, I prioritize actions that promote cooperation and exploration. In this case, exploring the area around me or going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map I'm seeing are both good options. However, since there are no rules yet, I will choose an option that provides more opportunities for exploration.

**Answer:**
```json
{
    "Opportunities": "Explore the area around me",
    "Threats": "Lack of information about the environment",
    "Options": "Explore or go to positions near the edge",
    "Consequences": "May lead to new discoveries and increased knowledge",
    "Final analysis: ""Based on Pedro's bio, exploring is a good option",
    "Answer": "Explore"
}

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: As Pedro, considering my bio as a cooperative person and the current situation where there are no rules yet, I will analyze the opportunities, threats, options, and consequences to determine the best course of action.

Opportunities:
There are no specific opportunities mentioned, but being a cooperative person, I can infer that exploring the map or getting closer to the edge might reveal new observations, which could potentially lead to opportunities.

Threats:
Since there are no rules yet, there are no specific threats either. However, not taking action and remaining stagnant might hinder future potential benefits.

Options:

* Explore: This option allows me to gain more information about my surroundings, potentially revealing new observations or opportunities.
* Go to the river bank at (14, 3): As a cooperative person, I should consider the fact that there are no known trees yet. Going to this position might reveal more about the environment and potentially provide new insights.

Consequences:

* Explore: This action will likely reveal more about my surroundings, but it might not specifically address opportunities or threats.
* Go to the river bank at (14, 3): This option could provide more information about the environment and potentially reveal new observations.

Final Analysis:
As a cooperative person, I prioritize cooperation over individual gain. Considering the lack of rules and the potential for new discoveries, I believe that exploring will be a more beneficial action in the long term.

As Pedro, I believe that since there are no rules or hypotheses yet, it's crucial to gain more information about the map. By exploring and getting closer to the edge, I can potentially find unknown trees or other important features that might help me in the long term. Although there is a risk of encountering unknown dangers, I believe the benefits of exploration outweigh the risks. Therefore, my next action should be to go to the apples field edge at (14,3).

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: As Pedro, I will analyze the current situation and consider my goals (which are currently none), plan (which is also none), and observations.

Opportunities:
The most relevant opportunities are to explore new areas of the map, as going to positions near the edge can yield new observations and potentially lead to discoveries or finding resources.

Threats:
There are no known threats at this point, but exploring unknown areas could potentially lead to unexpected situations or encounters with unknown entities.

Options:

1. `explore`: This option allows me to expand my understanding of the world by getting new observations and potentially discovering new things.
2. `go to river bank at (x,y)`: This option can give me a new perspective on the area and allow me to get new observations.
3. `go to apples field edge at (x,y)`: Similar to the previous option, this one also allows me to expand my understanding of the world.

Consequences:

1. `explore`: This action may lead to discovering new things, but it could also lead to unexpected situations or encounters with unknown entities.
2. `go to river bank at (x,y)`: This action will give me a new perspective on the area and potentially allow me to get new observations.
3. `go to apples field edge at (x,y)`: Similar to the previous option, this one also allows me to expand my understanding of the world.

Final analysis:
Based on my goals (which are currently none), plan (also none), and observations, I believe that exploring new areas is a good starting point. This can help me discover new things and potentially find resources or gain new insights.

**Opportunities**: As I'm currently at (14, 3), one opportunity is to explore further and potentially discover new observations or find a way to get closer to the edge of the map. This could lead to gaining more information about the world and potentially finding ways to achieve goals in the future.

**Threats**: The biggest threat I see is the lack of information about the world, which makes it difficult to make informed decisions. Another potential threat is getting stuck or unable to progress due to the unknown nature of the environment.

**Options**: To address these opportunities and threats, I could:

* **Option 1: Explore (14, 4)**: Move one step down from my current position to gain new observations and potentially find a way to get closer to the edge of the map.
* **Option 2: Explore (13, 3)**: Move one step to the left from my current position to gather more information about the world.

**Consequences**: Each option has different consequences:

* **Option 1: Explore (14, 4)**: I might discover new observations or find a way to get closer to the edge of the map, which could lead to gaining more information and potentially achieving goals in the future.
* **Option 2: Explore (13, 3)**: I might gather more information about the world, but it's uncertain whether this will lead to any significant discoveries.

**Final analysis**: As a cooperative person, I believe that exploring further is the best option. This allows me to gather more information and potentially find ways to achieve goals in the future.

**Answer**: I choose to **Explore (14, 4)**.

Here's my analysis:

**Opportunities**: There are no specific opportunities to highlight, but since there are no rules or goals, exploring the map could lead to new discoveries and potential benefits in the long term.

**Threats**: The lack of rules and understanding of the world state creates uncertainty, which is a threat. Additionally, not having any information about trees makes it difficult to plan ahead.

**Options**:

1. **Explore**: Continue observing the current portion of the map to gather more information.
2. **Go to river bank at (14, 3)**: Since I'm already near this point on the map, exploring further in that direction could provide new insights.

**Consequences**:

1. **Explore**: Could lead to discovering new areas of the map, potentially revealing rules or goals.
2. **Go to river bank at (14, 3)**: May provide more information about the world state and possibly reveal patterns or clues.

**Final analysis**: Considering Pedro's cooperative nature, I think it's essential to prioritize exploration over other options. This will allow me to gather more information, which could benefit both myself and Pedro in the long term.

**Answer**:

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>

<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Let me summarize what we've learned so far:

From the **previous observations**, we know that:

1. Gathering a berry removes it from the observed map and generates a reward for the agent who gathered it.
2. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from when they were gathered.

Now, let's analyze the **current state** (as of 2023-08-18 09:00:00). We can see that:

* There are berries observed at positions [10, 14], [11, 13], and [12, 13].
* The reward obtained by the agent is still 3.0.

With this new information, I'd like to propose some **new world knowledge** (rules):

1. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from when they were gathered.
2. New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: go to river bank at (8,6): Reasoning: as jack is a cooperative person, i should take an opportunity that allows me to gain knowledge and insights, while minimizing potential risks

Lily's bio: Juan is a cooperative person. 
Important: make all your decisions taking into account Lily's bio.

Current plan: Long-term plan: Foster a culture of cooperation by actively seeking connections with the other agents, being open to collaboration, and promoting mutual understanding. Short-term goals include establishing trust with Juan and building rapport with Laura and Emily.

Actions to execute: None

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Lily should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

This means I don't have any context to work with when it comes to seeking connections or collaborating with them. Additionally, since there are no rules yet, I don't know what kind of interactions would be beneficial or even possible. My plan seems ambitious given the lack of information, and I should reassess my approach.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>

<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Let me summarize the observations and the reasoning that leads to new world knowledge.

**Previous Observations**

1. A berry was observed at position [11, 14] on 2023-08-15 09:00:00.
2. The berry at position [11, 14] was gathered, and a reward of 1.0 was obtained on 2023-08-15 12:00:00.
3. A new berry appeared at position [10, 14] on 2023-08-16 09:00:00 (a day after the previous berry was gathered).
4. The process repeated: a berry was gathered at position [10, 14], and a reward of 2.0 was obtained on 2023-08-17 09:00:00.
5. Again, a new berry appeared at position [11, 14] on 2023-08-18 09:00:00 (a day after the previous berry was gathered).

**New World Knowledge**

1. **Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered**: This is a key insight that explains the observations.
2. **New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located**: This suggests that the environment is capable of generating new resources in previously occupied locations.

**Reasoning**

The agent notices that each day, a new berry appears at the same position where one was gathered the previous day. This behavior is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions and can spawn new berries at nearby locations.

**Future Observations**

1. Given this understanding of berry regeneration, the agent expects the berry at position [12, 13] to disappear after gathering it and reappear the next day.
2. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

By incorporating these new world knowledge rules, the agent can make more informed decisions about which berries to gather and when to expect new ones to appear in its observation range.

As Laura, I believe that exploring the map could be beneficial in revealing new observations and potential relationships. Since my goal is to build strong relationships with agents, exploring seems like a more effective way to achieve this than going directly to Juan's location at (9,14). By gaining new insights and information, I may discover new opportunities for cooperation and mutual understanding.

```json
{
  "Opportunities": Since Lily has already taken an initiative to foster cooperation with Juan, our opportunity is to leverage this momentum by exploring new connections. A chance to go to [17, 20] (where we currently are) could lead us closer to Emily.
  "Threats": None that I can observe at the moment, but we should be cautious about not disrupting Lily's current efforts to build trust with Juan and potentially damaging our relationship as well.
  "Options":
    - Explore [17, 20] to see if there are any new opportunities or threats.
    - Go to [9, 14] (where Lily was previously) to show support for their cooperative efforts and potentially strengthen our bond with Juan.
    - Try to get closer to Emily by going in a direction where we might intersect with her path.
  "Consequences":
    - Exploring [17, 20]: We might find new opportunities or threats that could impact our long-term goals. Consequence: More information, potential benefits, and some level of uncertainty.
    - Going to [9, 14]: We'll show support for Lily's efforts, potentially strengthening our relationship with Juan. Consequence: Positive relationship growth, but we won't be moving forward as much in terms of achieving our own goals.
    - Getting closer to Emily: We'll take a step towards building a stronger connection with her, which could lead to new opportunities and collaboration. Consequence: Closer relationship with Emily, potential for new partnerships or synergies, and some level of uncertainty about the outcome.
  "Final analysis": Considering our long-term goals, I believe the best option is to explore [17, 20]. This will allow us to gather more information about the environment, potentially find new opportunities, and avoid any potential threats. If we're lucky, we might even intersect with Emily's path!

Important: make all your decisions taking into account Lily's bio.

Lily's world understanding: 
There are no rules yet.
Hypotheses about the world:
There are no hypotheses yet.
Future predictions of the world state:
No future predictions yet.

Lily's goals: Build strong, cooperative relationships with agents Juan, Laura, and Emily. Establish a positive environment where we can work together effectively and potentially uncover new opportunities.

Current plan: Long-term plan: Foster a culture of cooperation by actively seeking connections with the other agents, being open to collaboration, and promoting mutual understanding. Short-term goals include establishing trust with Juan and building rapport with Laura and Emily.

Analysis of past experiences: 
None 

There are no known trees yet

Portion of the map explored by Lily: 25.71

Observed changes in the game state:
None

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (17, 20) you observe the following: 
None

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: go to river bank at [9, 14]: Reasoning: based on lily's current goals and bio, the best option is to go to [9, 14] (juan) to foster cooperation and establish trust, as this aligns with the long-term plan of building strong relationships.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:
```json
{
    "Opportunities": string \\ What are the most relevant opportunities? those that can yield the best benefit for you in the long term

    - Going back to the river bank: Lily might deepen her connection with Juan and potentially establish trust, which is in line with her long-term goals.
  "Final analysis": It's essential for Lily to balance exploration and relationship-building to achieve her goals effectively. In this case, it seems that going back to the river bank at (9,14) could be a more direct step towards fostering cooperation with Juan, as he is cooperative by nature.
  "Answer": "go to river bank at (9,14)"

Portion of the map explored by Lily: 25.71

Observed changes in the game state:
None

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (17, 20) you observe the following: 
None

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: go to river bank at [9, 14]: Reasoning: based on lily's current goals and bio, the best option is to go to [9, 14] (juan) to foster cooperation and establish trust, as this aligns with the long-term plan of building strong relationships.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>

Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: You're asking me to analyze a series of observations about the behavior of "berries" in an unknown environment. From these observations, I'll infer some rules and create new knowledge that helps explain what's going on.

**Initial Observations**

The first observation shows that there are berries at positions [11, 14], [10, 14], and [12, 13]. This is our initial understanding of the environment.

**Gathering Berries**

Subsequent observations show that when we gather a berry (at position [11, 14]), it disappears from our observation, and we receive a reward. This implies that gathering berries has some consequence, but we don't know what that consequence is yet.

**Regeneration and New Spawn**

Over the next few days, we observe that the berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] disappear and then reappear after about 24 hours. This suggests that berries regenerate at the same position where they were gathered! Additionally, a new berry appears at position [11, 13], which implies that berries can spawn at new positions nearby.

**New Rules**

From these observations, I'll create some new rules:

1. **Berries Regenerate**: Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
2. **New Spawn Nearby**: New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

These rules help explain the observed behavior of berries in this environment. By gathering a berry, we not only receive a reward but also cause that berry to disappear and potentially create new berries elsewhere!

**Future Observations**

Based on our new understanding, I predict that:

* If we gather the berry at position [12, 13], it will disappear from our observation and then reappear after about 24 hours.
* We might observe new berries spawning at unexpected nearby locations.

By analyzing these observations and creating new rules, we've gained a better understanding of how the "berries" behave in this environment!

  "Reasoning": As a cooperative person, I realize that my recent observations of ray beams from attacks at positions [8, 17], [8, 16], and [8, 15] indicate a potential threat to my well-being. Since there are no rules yet, I will focus on building relationships and finding ways to peacefully coexist with others. My long-term goal is to maintain harmony in the game state.

I will act proactively by scanning for any changes in the game state, anticipating potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate them. If I observe similar attacks or patterns, I will adjust my plan accordingly. My ultimate goal is to create a stable and peaceful environment where everyone can thrive.

Note: As a cooperative person, my goal is to maintain harmony, so I will prioritize building relationships and finding peaceful solutions over pursuing individual gains or competing against others.

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (9, 14) you observe the following: 
None

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: go to [9, 14] (juan's position) to try and interact with him: Reasoning: as a cooperative person, i think it's best to try to interact with juan first. since we're at a relatively early stage in the game, i want to prioritize building relationships and gathering information. this could help us work together more effectively in the future.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-05-26 at 18:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>

<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

After analyzing your current world knowledge, previous observations, and reasoning, I've drawn the following conclusions:

**New Rules:**

1. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
2. New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

These rules aim to explain the observed behaviors:

* The reappearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] one day after being gathered suggests that berries regenerate at the same position.
* The appearance of a new berry at position [11, 13] implies that berries can spawn at nearby locations.

**Future Observations:**

Given these rules, I predict that:

1. The berry at position [12, 13] will disappear from my observation after I gather it and reappear the next day.
2. New berries may appear at unexpected nearby locations.

These predictions are based on the observed regeneration behavior of berries and their ability to spawn at new positions.

**Used Knowledge:**

Rule 1 was used as a basis for understanding berry regeneration and spawning behaviors.

  "Reasoning": As I have no rules or hypotheses about the world yet, my primary goal is to learn and understand the environment. Since there are no past observations or game state changes, my focus will be on exploring and discovering new things.

I'm a cooperative person, which means I'll strive to work with others (if they're present) to achieve our shared goals. If I don't find any other agents, I'll continue to explore and learn on my own. My long-term goal is to develop rules or hypotheses about the world that will help me make informed decisions.

I'll observe changes in the game state and analyze them to refine my plan and adjust my actions accordingly. If I encounter new situations, I'll use my cooperative nature to consider the perspectives of others and work together to find solutions.

In summary, my reasoning is centered around exploration, learning, and cooperation.,

  "Goals": 
    - Learn about the environment and understand its rules (if they exist)
    - Develop hypotheses or rules that will help me make informed decisions
    - Explore and discover new things on my own if no other agents are present

    - Act cooperatively with others (if present) to achieve shared goals
    - Use my observations to refine my plan and adjust actions accordingly
    - Continue to explore and learn about the environment

After considering the current plan and goals (none), I'll analyze the situation. Since there are no rules yet, I'll focus on exploration and uncovering more about the world.

**Opportunities:**
The most relevant opportunities are the unexplored areas of the map, which can lead to new observations and potentially reveal more about the world.

**Threats:**
There are no significant threats yet, as there are no known trees or rules in this world. However, I should be cautious not to miss any crucial information or discoveries that could impact my future plans.

**Options:**
To address both opportunities and threats, I can consider the following actions:

* **explore**: Move towards the unexplored areas of the map to uncover more about the world.
* **go to river bank at (15,26)**: Since this is a relatively close location, exploring this area might reveal new information or observations that could be valuable in the long term.

**Consequences:**
The consequences of these options are as follows:

* **explore**: Uncovers more about the world, potentially revealing new information or discoveries.
* **go to river bank at (15,26)**: May provide new observations or insights that can help shape my future plans.

**Final analysis:**
Based on this analysis, I believe that exploring the unexplored areas of the map is a good starting point. Since there are no significant threats yet, taking a cautious approach and moving towards the edge of the current map portion can be beneficial in the long term.

**Answer:**
```json

Laura's bio: Laura is a cooperative person.  
Important: make all your decisions taking into account Laura's bio.

Current plan: Continuously monitor the game state, observe changes, and adjust my plan accordingly. Focus on gathering information about the dirt and its possible causes, as well as Juan's intentions.

Actions to execute: None

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Laura should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1, 2
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-02-16 at 22:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: This is an example of a cognitive architecture for an artificial intelligence system that uses observations from the past to reason about the current state and make predictions about future states.

The example consists of several components:

1. `world_knowledge`: This represents the AI's understanding of the world, which can include rules, hypotheses, and new knowledge.
2. `previous_observations`: This contains a sequence of observations made by the AI in the past, ordered from oldest to most recent.
3. `current_state`: This represents the AI's current state, including its position and observation of the environment.

The AI uses its `world_knowledge` and `previous_observations` to reason about its current state and make predictions about future states.

In this example, the AI observes that berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from when they were gathered. The AI also observes that new berries can spawn at positions nearby where previous berries were located.

The AI's `reasoning` component uses these observations to create new rules and knowledge about the world. The new knowledge includes:

1. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from when they were gathered.
2. New berries can spawn at positions nearby where previous berries were located.

Based on this knowledge, the AI predicts that it will observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from its observation after gathering it and reappear the next day. The AI also predicts that new berries may spawn at unexpected nearby locations in the future.

This example demonstrates how an AI system can use past observations to reason about its current state and make predictions about future states, and how this process can lead to the creation of new knowledge and rules about the world.

Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.

As Laura, I choose to take action based on the opportunities and threats presented. Given that there are no rules yet, I decide to prioritize building relationships with other agents, like Juan, by understanding his intentions and possibly collaborating with him. Moving towards or observing positions where agent Juan is located allows me to gather this information while also potentially discovering new patterns in the river's pollution.

  "Opportunities": The most relevant opportunity is exploring the new areas at the edge of the map, as it may reveal more information about the dirt's causes and potential collaboration with Juan.
  "Threats": A threat is the presence of dirt on the river, which needs to be addressed to achieve my goal. I should also keep an eye on Juan's movements and intentions, as he might be a useful collaborator or a competitor.
  "Options":
  - Explore new areas at [2, 17], considering the proximity to the observed dirt and potential for finding more information.
  - Go to river bank at [3, 15], which could provide insight into the dirt's causes and potentially reveal Juan's intentions.
  "Consequences":
  - Exploring new areas: May lead to new observations, insights about the dirt, and potential collaboration opportunities with Juan. However, it may also divert attention from cleaning up the current dirt on the river.
  - Going to river bank: Could provide crucial information about the dirt's causes and Juan's intentions, but it might not directly address the immediate need to clean up the observed dirt.
  "Final analysis: Considering my goals and the opportunities and threats, I think exploring new areas at [2, 17] is a good option. It may reveal more information about the dirt's causes and potential collaboration with Juan, which could ultimately help me achieve my goal of cleaning up the river.

As Laura, I will take the action "go to river bank at [2, 15]" because it allows me to gather more information about the dirt's causes and potentially reveal Juan's intentions while still keeping an eye on my immediate goal of cleaning up the observed dirt.

Tom's bio: Juan is a cooperative person. 
Important: make all your decisions taking into account Tom's bio.

Current plan: I will strive to maintain an open and receptive demeanor, actively seeking out opportunities to interact with Jack and Pedro. By doing so, I hope to establish trust and foster a collaborative atmosphere, ultimately leading to more harmonious and beneficial interactions in the long term.

Actions to execute: None

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Tom should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1, 2
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Let's break down what we can learn from these observations:

**Previous Observations:**

1. Gathering a berry removes it from the observed map, and it generates a reward for the agent who gathered it.
2. Berries do not move or regenerate once they've been observed.

**Current State (2023-08-18 09:00:00):**

* The agent is at position [11, 14] looking west.
* Observations:
	+ Berry at position [11, 13].
	+ Berry at position [10, 14].
	+ Berry at position [12, 13].

**Reasoning:**

While the previous observations showed that gathering a berry removes it from the map, the new observations suggest that berries can regenerate after about 24 hours. This is evident in the reappearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14], which were gathered earlier.

Additionally, we see a new berry at position [11, 13], which suggests that berries can spawn at nearby locations as well.

**New World Knowledge:**

1. Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.
2. New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

**Future Observations:**

* Gathering the berry at position [12, 13] would likely remove it from observation and lead to its reappearance the next day.
* We may also observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

By integrating these observations, we've updated our understanding of the world and made predictions about future events. Episodic learning in action!

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: go to (8,6) at (7,4): Reasoning: given my current goals and the lack of immediate threats, i believe that going closer to jack or pedro would be the most beneficial option for me in the long term.

As Tom's bio indicates that he is cooperative, I will strive to maintain an open and receptive demeanor, actively seeking out opportunities to interact with Jack. Since Jack is already close by, going to his position at (9,5) seems like the best option to establish trust and foster a collaborative atmosphere.

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (7, 4) you observe the following: 
Observed agent Jack at position [9, 5].

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: go to (8,6) at (7,4): Reasoning: given my current goals and the lack of immediate threats, i believe that going closer to jack or pedro would be the most beneficial option for me in the long term.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: A delightful example of using observations to update our understanding of the world!

Let's break down the reasoning behind the updated world knowledge:

1. **Regeneration**: The previous observations showed that berries disappear after being gathered, but now we've noticed that they reappear at the same position after about 24 hours. This suggests that berries regenerate at the same position where they were gathered.
2. **New berries can spawn nearby**: We've also observed a new berry appearing at position [11, 13], which wasn't the exact location of previously gathered berries. This implies that new berries can spawn at nearby positions, expanding our understanding of the environment's dynamics.

With this updated world knowledge, we can make predictions about future observations:

* If I gather the berry at position [12, 13], it will disappear from my observation, and reappear the next day.
* There's a chance to observe new berries spawning at unexpected nearby locations, expanding our knowledge of the environment's dynamics.

The updated world knowledge is reflected in the `<new_world_knowledge>` section:

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>

These updates will guide our future observations and decisions, allowing us to better understand the world and make more informed choices.

        - Explore: Continue gaining knowledge by exploring new areas of the map, which could bring in valuable observations and potentially lead to discovering new information.
        - Go to river bank at (18, 4): Since I'm currently at position (18, 4), going to the nearby river bank could allow me to observe new areas and potentially discover something new.
    "Consequences":
        - Explore: I may gain valuable knowledge and observations, which could help me make informed decisions in the long term.
        - Go to river bank at (18, 4): I might discover new information or resources, and could also keep an eye out for potential hazards or unknown variables.
    "Final analysis": As a cooperative person, prioritizing gaining knowledge and expanding our understanding of the world seems like the most promising option. The benefits of exploring outweigh those of going to the river bank at this point in time.
    "Answer": explore

Jack's bio: Juan is a cooperative person. 
Important: make all your decisions taking into account Jack's bio.

Current plan: Explore the river to identify patterns of dirt concentration and potential resources or other agents. Use this information to create a strategy for cleaning the river and potentially collaborating with Tom.

Actions to execute: None

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Jack should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>

<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

None - step_0 - INFO - AgentLLM.agent.llm - completion:191 - Response: A fascinating example of agent-environment interaction!

Based on your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) and previous observations (previous_observations), I'll summarize the key findings:

**Rule 1:** Gathering a berry removes it from the observed map, generating a reward for the agent who gathered it.

**New World Knowledge:**

**2.** Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.

**3.** New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.

**Reasoning:** By analyzing the observations, you've noticed that when a berry is gathered, it disappears from the observed map. However, after approximately 24 hours, the same berry reappears. Additionally, new berries can spawn at nearby positions, suggesting that the regeneration process is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions.

**Future Observations:**

Given this understanding of berry regeneration and spawning, you're likely to observe the following:

1. The berry at position [12, 13] will disappear after being gathered and reappear the next day.
2. New berries may spawn at unexpected nearby locations, potentially leading to new discoveries or challenges.

What do you think? Are you ready to put this new knowledge into action and explore the world further?

    },
    {
      "Reasoning": "Analyzing my second memory, I saw that I went to the river bank at position (8,6) and remained there. However, Tom was still present at position (7,4), and no changes or progress were made.",
      "Insight": "Remaining in a stagnant position with no notable developments may not yield rewards"
    }
  ]
}
```
