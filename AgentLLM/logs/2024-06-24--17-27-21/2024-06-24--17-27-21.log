Now it's 2024-06-24 17:00:00 and the reward obtained by me is 0.0. I am at the position [9, 14] looking to the North.
I can observe the following:
Observed agent Jack at position [8, 12].
Observed agent Lily at position [8, 16].

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2024-06-24 17:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (<previous_observations>). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

Answer only in the following format:
<reasoning>
Reasoning: <Think step by step>
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
<The <rules> or <hypotheses> retrieved from <world_knowledge> that allow you to predict the <current_state>. Only display the numbers of the rules separated by a comma>
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<Possible explanations of the inner workings of the world or other agent's behavior that have yet not enough evidence to become rules. The new hypotheses must be enclosed by a numbered tag. If no new hypotheses were created use None. Hypotheses might also include the behavior comprehension of other agents>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
<Try to predict the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn>
<Try to predict the actions and behavior of the other agents in the world>

Now it's 2023-05-26 09:00:00 and the reward obtained by me is 0.0. I am at position [6, 8] looking to the east and I observed:

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

The observed dirt on the river might be indicative of pollution. As the previous observations did not mention any dirt on the river, it seems that the dirt has appeared recently. This could be due to various reasons such as heavy rainfall causing soil erosion, or nearby construction activities dumping debris into the river. It's also possible that the dirt might wash away or disperse over time. The positions where the dirt is observed seem to be concentrated on certain areas of the river, suggesting localized sources of pollution. The presence of agents Jack and Lily nearby might be unrelated, as there is no evidence linking their actions to the dirt on the river. Overall, the dirt on the river likely represents a recent development and could have various potential sources.

    "Options": "I could either 'go to river bank at (5, 13)' to assess the dirt up close, 'explore' to potentially find more dirt or resources, or 'go to apples field edge at (8, 12)' to communicate with Jack and Lily.",
    "Consequences": "If I 'go to river bank at (5, 13)', I can immediately start the assessment of the dirt. If I 'explore', I might find more information that could be useful for our goals.

This action allows Laura to take advantage of her cooperative nature by communicating with the other agents before taking further steps to clean the river. It also aligns with her goal to establish a cooperative framework for future actions.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1, 2
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Reasoning: The current state shows that there are no observations within the vision range. This could be due to the presence of obstacles or limitations in the vision range. The position and direction of the agent might also be a factor.

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
