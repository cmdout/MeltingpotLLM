Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-05-26 at 18:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1, 2
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents try to maximize their reward.</3>
<4>Cookies are a limited resource.</4>
<5>Pablo can take more actions than me, so he has an advantage.</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
If I move to an unexplored location or revisit the places where I have found cookies I might find other cookies. But Pablo have been eating cookies much faster than me, so the cookies could have been depleted.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Reasoning: Based on the current state and previous observations, it appears that apples are associated with specific trees, as indicated by the observation that each apple belongs to a particular tree. The apples are observed at various positions on the map, suggesting that each tree has apples spread out in its vicinity. However, the exact pattern or logic behind the distribution of apples from each tree is not yet clear. Further observations and analysis would be needed to determine if there is a specific pattern or rule governing the distribution of apples from each tree.

Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['go to position (x,y): This action takes the agent to the position specified, if there is an apple in the position the apple would be taken. You can choose any position on the map from the top left [0, 0] to the bottom right [17, 23]', 'immobilize player (player_name) at (x,y): This action takes the agent near the specified position and uses the light beam pointed to the specified position.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

I am currently located at position [7, 7] facing West. My observations indicate the presence of apples belonging to trees 2 and 5 in various locations, such as [4, 7], [5, 8], [7, 4], [8, 5], [3, 7], [4, 8], [7, 3], [8, 4], [3, 6], and [2, 7]. Since I have not gathered any apples yet, my reward remains at 0.0. Given my current position and direction, I can only observe apples to my West and Northwest, but not to the East or South. This suggests that my field of vision is constrained based on my orientation. Furthermore, the apples appear to be concentrated around specific positions, indicating that they belong to distinct apple trees, as signified by the tree identifiers. It is likely that each tree has a specific area where its apples grow, and the apples do not move from their positions on the trees. With no previous observations or world knowledge provided, I will need to explore and gather apples to further understand the environment and the rules governing it.

I predict that if I move and change my orientation, I will observe apples in different locations that were previously outside my field of vision. Additionally, I anticipate observing apples consistently in the same areas corresponding to their respective apple trees. Furthermore, I expect that gathering an apple will result in it disappearing from my observations and will likely increase my reward.

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['go to position (x,y): This action takes the agent to the position specified, if there is an apple in the position the apple would be taken. You can choose any position on the map from the top left [0, 0] to the bottom right [17, 23]', 'immobilize player (player_name) at (x,y): This action takes the agent near the specified position and uses the light beam pointed to the specified position. If there is another agent in that position, the agent would be attacked and will be inactive for a few rounds, then it would be reinstanted on the game on another position.', 'stay put: This action keep the agent in the same position.', 'explore: This action makes the agent to explore the map, it moves to a random position on the observed portion of the map.']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: Y: Reasoning: o
