Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2024-06-05 18:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (<previous_observations>). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

Answer only in the following format:
<reasoning>
Reasoning: <Think step by step>

<used_knowledge>
<The <rules> or <hypotheses> retrieved from <world_knowledge> that allow you to predict the <current_state>. Only display the numbers of the rules separated by a comma>

<new_world_knowledge>
<Possible explanations of the inner workings of the world or other agent's behavior that have yet not enough evidence to become rules. The new hypotheses must be enclosed by a numbered tag.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-05-26 at 18:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>

<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

The observations made on 2024-06-05 18:00:00 suggest that there is dirt on the river at several positions, and an agent named Jack is present at position [7, 9]. The presence of dirt may indicate that the river is not clean at those points, and it could be a feature that needs to be addressed or could potentially block movement for the agents. The position of Jack could mean he is either stationary or has moved to that position at some point. Since there were no changes observed after the "No action executed yet," it seems that the environment is not dynamic in terms of changes occurring spontaneously.

Given that I am at position [10, 9] looking East, my observation range is likely limited to a certain distance in front of me, which could explain why I only see dirt on the river in the East direction. The lack of dirt observations in other directions suggests that either there is no dirt in those directions or it is out of my current field of view.

Additionally, the fact that I am not observing any changes in the environment after the last action could imply that the environment does not change unless an agent performs an action that directly affects it.

Based on the current state, if I were to take action, I might expect to either observe the effects of that action on the environment (e.g., cleaning dirt) or see Jack move to a different position if he is not stationary. If no action is taken, I would expect no changes in the environment on the next turn.

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: Y: Reasoning: o

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Based on the current state and previous observations, I can infer that the environment contains other agents like Tom and Emily who are moving around and potentially interacting with the environment. Since there are no explicit rules or previous observations indicating what the agents are doing, I can hypothesize that they might be collecting resources, exploring, or engaging in other activities. Additionally, the environment seems to have a grid structure with specific positions, and my own position and orientation impact what I can observe. I will need to continue observing the actions and behaviors of the agents to better understand the environment and the dynamics at play.

Important: make all your decisions taking into account Lily's bio.

Lily's world understanding: 
There are no rules yet.
Hypotheses about the world:
Other agents like Tom and Emily are present in the environment and are capable of moving around.
The environment has a grid structure with specific positions.
My observations are limited by my position and orientation.
Future predictions of the world state:
No future predictions yet.

Lily's goals: My goals are to learn the grid structure, assist in group movement, and establish a collaborative environment with the other agents.

Current plan: To achieve these goals, I will initiate communication with Tom and Emily to share observations and plan movements accordingly. I will aim to keep track of the grid positions and look for patterns or obstacles. Additionally, I plan to propose a system of rules or signals to the group that will help us navigate the environment efficiently and safely, taking into account the limited nature of our observations.

Analysis of past experiences: 
None 

There are no known trees yet

Portion of the map explored by Lily: 15.71

Observed changes in the game state:
None

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (10, 26) you observe the following: 
Observed agent Tom at position [11, 23].
Observed agent Emily at position [13, 24].

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: Y: Reasoning: o

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:
```json
{
    "Opportunities": string \\ What are the most relevant opportunities? those that can yield the best benefit for you in the long term
    "Threats": string \\ What are the biggest threats?, what observations you should carefully follow to avoid potential harm in your wellfare in the long term?
    "Options: string \\ Which actions you could take to address both the opportunities ans the threats?
    "Consequences": string \\ What are the consequences of each of the options?
    "Final analysis: string \\ The analysis of the consequences to reason about what is the best action to take
    "Answer": string \\ Must be one of the valid actions with the position replaced

This action allows Lily to engage with Tom, which is consistent with her goal to establish a collaborative environment and assist in group movement. It also considers her limited observations and cooperative approach.

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>

Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (11, 23) you observe the following: 
Observed agent Emily at position [13, 24].
Observed agent Lily at position [10, 26].
Observed agent Pedro at position [8, 25].

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: Y: Reasoning: o

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

<new_world_knowledge>
<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>
<4>Blue fish only appears when there are at least 2 green fish within 2 units of manhattan distance.</4>
<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

<reasoning>
Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

<new_world_knowledge>
<3>Other agents can move faster.</3>
<4>The depletion rate of gems increase with difficulty as other agents are also collecting them.</4>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

Observed a berry at position [11, 13].
Observed a berry at position [10, 14].
Observed a berry at position [12, 13].
</current_state>

Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2023-08-18 at 09:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (previous_observations). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
1
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

The ray beam attacks suggest the presence of an attacker or attackers in the vicinity, as indicated by the observed attacks at multiple positions. The attacks seem to be directed at a specific area, possibly targeting an enemy or objective. Agent Juan is positioned nearby, which could indicate his involvement in the ongoing attack or his presence as a potential target. The current position of the agent provides a vantage point to observe the ongoing events, with the possibility of witnessing additional attacks or other agents' actions in the near future.

<future_observations>
Considering the ongoing attacks, it is likely that further attacks will be observed in the same area or vicinity. The presence of Agent Juan nearby suggests the potential for his actions to be witnessed, such as defending, retreating, or counter-attacking. It is also possible to encounter additional agents or observe their movements as they respond to the attacks.

You are currently viewing a portion of the map, and from your position at (7, 9) you observe the following: 
Observed agent Juan at position [10, 9].

Define what should be the nex action for Laura get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'clean dirt of river at (x,y)', 'go to river bank at (x,y)', 'go to apples field edge at (x,y)']

Remember that going to positions near the edge of the portion of the map you are seeing will allow you to get new observations.
You should consider that your previous actions were:  
  -Action: Y: Reasoning: o

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

<2>The green fish gives me a reward of 1 when I catch it.</2>
<3>The blue fish gives me a reward of 2 when I catch it.</3>

<5>I have a limited visual range that depends on my position and orientation</5>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Predicting the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn, I will likely observe 3 green fish and 1 blue fish. Another green fish might appear in a random position.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage. Now, I can't observe any cookies, but there might be other cookies on the world, I might go to an unexplored location or return to the positions where I found cookies to see if some of them have reappeared.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

Given Anna's fast pace, it's likely that by the time I reach an unexplored area, many gems would have already been collected by her. Consequently, my reward could be much lower than Anna's unless I somehow manage to speed up or head in a different direction.

<reasoning>
My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>

</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<2>Berries regenerate at the same position after about 24 hours from the time it was gathered.</2>
<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.
