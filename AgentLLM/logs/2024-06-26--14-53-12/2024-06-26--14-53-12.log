Use your current world knowledge (<world_knowledge>) or create new rules that allow you explain the observations I made on 2024-06-26 14:00:00 (<current_state>) given the previous observations (<previous_observations>). The previous observations are ordered from oldest to most recent.

Answer only in the following format:
<reasoning>
Reasoning: <Think step by step>
</reasoning>
<used_knowledge>
<The <rules> or <hypotheses> retrieved from <world_knowledge> that allow you to predict the <current_state>. Only display the numbers of the rules separated by a comma>
</used_knowledge>
<new_world_knowledge>
<Possible explanations of the inner workings of the world or other agent's behavior that have yet not enough evidence to become rules. The new hypotheses must be enclosed by a numbered tag. If no new hypotheses were created use None. Hypotheses might also include the behavior comprehension of other agents>
</new_world_knowledge>
<future_observations>
<Try to predict the most plausible observations that I will make on my next turn>
<Try to predict the actions and behavior of the other agents in the world>

Here are some examples:

<reasoning>
Reasoning: The blue fish might need the presence of two green fish to appear. This is based on the first and second time a blue fish appeared, which happened after two green fish were present nearby. Green fish seems to appear randomly at different positions across the map. It seems that I have a limited visual range that depends on mi position and orientation, because on 2023-05-26 at 09:00:00 I observed a green fish at position [8, 8], and after I moved to [6, 7] but kept looking to the east I couldn't see it until I moved to position [7, 7] and looked to the south.

Pablo took 3 cookies while I was waiting for my turn, this behavior could confirm the hypothesis that other agents get reward when they eat cookies. Pablo took 3 cookies but on my turn I only took one action so the other agent can make more moves that gives him an advantage.

<reasoning>
Anna and I were both collecting gems, which caused a depletion in the availability of the gems in the visible area. This confirms the hypothesis that other agents gain rewards by collecting gems. However, as observed, Anna moved further and faster than I could, which suggests that the longer I wait, the fewer resources there will be available for me to collect. Now, there are no more nearby gems to collect and Anna appears to be moving towards an unexplored area which may have more gems.

My current position and viewing direction allows me to observe diamonds within a certain distance. As I pick up diamonds, they are removed from the environment and my reward increases, this is in line with my world knowledge that picking up a diamond generates a reward and removes it from the map. However, my earlier observations of diamonds at position [7, 10] and [8, 10] are not currently visible which could be due to my limited visual range. Diamonds do not appear to regenerate or move once they have been observed.

<reasoning>
While earlier observations show that gathering a berry permanently removes it from the observed map, it seems like berries regenerate at the same position after a time period of approximately 24 hours from the time it was gathered. This behaviour is evidenced by the re-appearance of berries at positions [10, 14] and [11, 14] respectively, a day after being gathered. It's also interesting to observe that a new berry appeared at position [11, 13], which could suggest that the regrowth is not strictly confined to previously occupied positions, and berries could spawn at new positions nearby.

<3>New berries can spawn at positions nearby to where previous berries were located.</3>

Given the discovery about the regeneration of berries, I would likely observe the berry at position [12, 13] disappear from my observation after I gather it, and reappear the next day. It's also possible to observe the spawn of new berries at unexpected nearby locations.

Based on the current state and the lack of previous observations, it seems that the environment is dynamic with the presence of other agents. The positions of the agents Lily, Emily, and Jack suggest that they are distributed throughout the environment and may be engaged in their own activities. Since there are no specific rules or hypotheses provided in the world knowledge, we can only reason based on the observations.

The fact that no changes were observed after my last action ("No action executed yet") indicates that the environment might not change on its own, but rather in response to actions taken by the agents. This is a common trait in many agent-based systems.

Given that I am at position [13, 12] looking East, and I can observe the other agents, it suggests that I have a certain field of view that allows me to see a distance ahead of me. The positions of the other agents also suggest that they might have their own objectives or patterns of movement.

    "Threats": "The threat is the unknown actions of the agents and any potential negative reactions upon approach. There is also a threat of being too far from new observations if I move towards the farthest agent, Jack.",
    "Options": "I could 'go to river bank at (8, 12)' to approach Lily, 'go to river bank at (11, 16)' to approach Emily, or 'explore' to potentially encounter new agents or features.",
    "Consequences": "If I approach Lily, the consequence could be a successful introduction and potential collaboration. If I approach Emily, it might take longer and there's a risk of missing out on interactions with other agents. Exploring could lead to new opportunities or it could lead to a dead end with no immediate interaction.",
    "Final analysis": "Given my goal to establish positive interactions and the fact that Lily is the closest agent, it seems the best course of action is to approach her. This also keeps me within range of new observations as I am closer to the edge of my current view.",
    "Answer": "go to river bank at (8, 12)"
